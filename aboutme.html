  <h1>About Me</h1>
    
<p>Since I was young, I have always been interested in understanding mathematics. In secondary school, I was not particularly fascinated by physics. However, during my first year of high school, I was fortunate to have a great teacher who sparked my interest in the subject. From that moment on, I became increasingly drawn to physics, and in my final year of high school, I chose to join a group in the Physics-Mathematics area. </p>
  
<p>I knew for sure that I wanted to study physics when I participated in the ALICE International MasterClass during my last year of high school. The class was given by a group of researchers from the Institute of Nuclear Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and I was amazed by the broad scope of physics. Later, I applied for a degree in Physics, and I was accepted. </p>

<h2>My experience</h2>
  
<p> I am currently studying it, and although it has been challenging, it has made me appreciate the beauty of mathematics even more and the wonder of studying and understanding it.
 At the moment, I have not decided which area to specialize in, but I am interested in theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of high energies or particle physics. </p>
  
 <h2>Some social causes i care about</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
   <li><b> Sustainable housing (2022 - )</b></li>
      <ul>
    <li>I am part of the Emiliano Zapata Popular Revolutionary Union (UPREZ), a Mexican social organization that is part of the popular urban movement. It is present in different states of the Mexican Republic and among its objectives is to improve the living conditions of the Mexican population through grassroots social struggle in the countryside and the city.</li>
     </ul>
